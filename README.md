A collection of small programs written in visual python simulating various physical laws as I learn them.
current: 
 * fundamental orbital mechanics
 * dampened harmonic motion
 * relativistic motion of small particles
in progress:
 * light and wave functions
 * inter-atomic forces
 * 
todo
 * visualization of interesting mathematical sets ie julia sets.
