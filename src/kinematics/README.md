Summary of Project - For this project, I programmed some basic rules of Newtonian physics applied on balls
shot out at a random velocity and at a random angle.

The project is divided up into three files - The Main.Java and the Ball.java

	Main - The Main.java is the driver of the program...handling the run conditions and the primary rendering.
	
	Ball - The Ball.java is a simple class which contains information regarding any ball's velocity, position, and size.
		During this project, I tried to utilize a more "organized" way of programming by defining private variables wherever I could.
